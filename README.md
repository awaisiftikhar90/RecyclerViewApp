Key Features:
RecyclerView Implementation: The app utilizes RecyclerView to display the list of available text files efficiently.
Smooth Scrolling: The RecyclerView is optimized for smooth and efficient scrolling, even with a large number of files




In Android, when implementing a RecyclerView, you typically use the following methods to set up and populate the RecyclerView:
onCreateViewHolder
onBindViewHolder
getItemCount()

These three methods are part of the RecyclerView's Adapter class, which you need to extend when creating your custom adapter for the RecyclerView.

Additionally, it's common to define a custom ViewHolder class that holds references to the views within each item in the RecyclerView. This ViewHolder class should extend RecyclerView.ViewHolder. Here's a simplified example:
